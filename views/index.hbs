			<p>The basic idea of the project is when a client - Tim is going out to get some food or groceries. He might only need one or two items. However, another client - Ashley who is living close to Tim also need an item from the location that is is going to. Then, Tim can pick up the item and deliver to Ashley. This method of P2P platform not only save Ashley’s time, it also allows Tim to utilize his time better since he will earn some money or special offer after the delivery. </p>
